Do whatever you want to my code. Steal it, modify it, create a weapon of mass destruction, etc... from parts or in whole.
Just don't sell anything that contains Nintendo code (after all, you don't want Nintendo lawyers to stop your plans for world domination).

Credit would be nice if you use it. Even something as small and as simple as "Special thanks to Buu342" :(

I WOULD use a WTFPL license on this, but I have to put emphasis on "DON'T SELL NINTENDO CODE YOU TOSSPOT OR YOU WILL SCREW OVER THE HOMEBREW COMMUNITY".
